// Swapping best algorithms
1..*if a and b are the two variables we need to swap their values without third variable*
----
a = b-a;
b = b-a;
a = b+a;

2.. * By using third variable we can swap easyly *
----
let's take an empty variable is called temp
temp = a;
a = b;
b = temp;

3.. * Finally we can also swap them by using binary number system.....*
